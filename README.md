# task description
Let's say that there exists a machine that gives out free coins, but with a twist!

Separating two people is a wall, and this machine is placed in such a way that both people are able to access it. Spending a coin in this machine will give the person on the other side 3 coins and vice versa.

If both people continually spend coins for each other (SHARING), then they'll both gain a net profit of 2 coins per turn. However, there is always the possibility for someone to act selfishly (STEALING): they spend no coins, yet they still receive the generous 3 coin gift from the other person!
